# Project 1: Valhalla Traffic Integration for Careem
## Overview
A Python-based solution for integrating historical traffic data with Valhalla's routing engine to improve ETA accuracy for Careem's ride-hailing platform in Amman, Jordan. This implementation enhances Valhalla's routing capabilities without modifying its core C++ codebase.

# Project 2: Time-Series Demand Forecasting with SARIMAX
## Overview
This Jupyter notebook implements time series forecasting using SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with eXogenous variables) models. The analysis includes:

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Time series decomposition and seasonality analysis
- Model parameter selection using ACF and PACF
- SARIMAX model training and forecasting
- Model evaluation using RMSE, MSE, MAE, and Theil's U-statistic
- Residual analysis and diagnostic tests
