# [Project 1: Valhalla Traffic Integration for Careem](https://github.com/muhammadazzazy/osm-valhalla-traffic-mapper)
## Overview
A Python-based solution for integrating historical traffic data with Valhalla's routing engine to improve ETA accuracy for Careem's ride-hailing platform in Amman, Jordan. This implementation enhances Valhalla's routing capabilities without modifying its core C++ codebase.

# [Project 2: Time-Series Demand Forecasting with SARIMAX](https://github.com/muhammadazzazy/osm-valhalla-traffic-mapper)
## Overview
This Jupyter notebook implements time series forecasting using SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with eXogenous variables) models. The analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Time series decomposition and seasonality analysis
- Model parameter selection using ACF and PACF
- SARIMAX model training and forecasting
- Model evaluation using RMSE, MSE, MAE, and Theil's U-statistic
- Residual analysis and diagnostic tests

# [Project 3: ProcLynx: The Linux Process Manager (LPM)](https://github.com/muhammadazzazy/proclynx)
## Overview
ProcLynx is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) task manager capable of
- killing Linux processes by name and ID
- displaying process table showing the process ID, name, percentage memory utilization, and percentage processor utilization
- showing GPU temperatures, system information, processor information, disk temperatures, and component information
